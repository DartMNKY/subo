# subo
### The perfect little script for misogynistic dyslexic streamers. 

Let's say you're misogynistic and dyslexic. While you're streaming, someone sends you a little sus command that says something like "subo apt install grub". You check the script and because you're dyslexic, you miss the little typo in "sudo" and proceed to enter the command. The terminal asks for your password, as expected, but when you hit enter, BOOM a dumbass cow spews out your password for your whole audience to see and take note of! You did this to yourself by running subo_installation_v1.sh, you signed up for this.
